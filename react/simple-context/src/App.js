					Context provides a way to pass data through 
					the component tree without having to pass props 
					down manually at every level.

					In a typical React application, data is passed 
					top-down (parent to child) via props, but this 
					can be cumbersome for certain types of props 
					(e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are 
					required by many components within an application. 
					Context provides a way to share values like 
					these between components without having to 
					explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
